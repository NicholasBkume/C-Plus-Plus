This C++ code is a simple program that performs the following actions:

Includes necessary headers:

#include "stdafx.h": This is typically used in Visual Studio projects for precompiled headers to speed up compilation.
#include <iostream>: This allows the program to use input and output streams (cin and cout).
Defines the main function: The entry point of the program.

Initializes variables:

int x = -500;: Initializes an integer variable x with the value -500.
int num;: Declares an integer variable num.
Executes a while loop:

The loop condition is x <= 500, meaning the loop will continue as long as x is less than or equal to 500.
Inside the loop:
cout << "value is : " << x << endl;: Outputs the current value of x to the console.
x = x + 100;: Increments the value of x by 100.
Reads an integer input from the user:

cin >> num;: Waits for the user to input an integer and assigns it to the variable num. This line essentially pauses the program to allow the user to see the output before it terminates.
Returns 0:

return 0;: Indicates that the program executed successfully.
Summary
This program initializes a variable x to -500 and then enters a while loop that increments x by 100 on each iteration. It prints the value of x during each iteration. The loop continues until x exceeds 500. After the loop, the program waits for the user to enter an integer before terminating.
